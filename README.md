# 🎮 Lugx - Gaming Website Clone

## 📝 Description
**Lugx** is a frontend project that I created based on a design I found online. For my learning experience, I recreated it from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project showcases the design and features of a modern gaming website, including sections for games, news, and community discussions. The website aims to provide information and entertainment to gaming enthusiasts.

Developed for learning purposes, **Lugx** is fully responsive, interactive, and visually appealing. It mimics the look and feel of popular gaming websites and incorporates game-related content, smooth user interactions, and dynamic features.

This project was developed as part of a learning exercise and is based on a design I found online. I then recreated the template into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch.

No design is original to the source, and the intention was purely to improve my web development skills.
